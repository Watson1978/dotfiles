# .gitattributes_global is the user-specific global path attributes configuration file for Git. To
# work, this file must be specified as the global configuration file using the core.attributesfile
# variable in the Git configuration. See:
#
#     http://git-scm.com/docs/gitattributes.html
#     https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-config.html
#
# for more information, including a description of configuration file, command-line option, and
# environment variable precedence.

# Setting the diff attribute for a specific file type chooses a language-specific set of patterns to
# use when generating diff header hunks.
